# Jetpack Compose Talk
A simple project to show off Jetpack Compose for the purposes of a talk. The `main` branch contains the compose code, there is also an `xml` branch that shows how you would implement the same UI the current way in Android.

The app connects to [TheSportsDB](https://www.thesportsdb.com/) to pull all teams in the English Premier League.

Selecting a team from the list will open a detail screen showing a description of the team with floating action buttons to navigate to the team's social media pages.
